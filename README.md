# bca-protein-analysis
For this project I wanted to create a Python script to analyze data from a BCA Protein Assay reading, a test molecular biologists use to measure protein concentrations in lab samples. The script reads data from an Excel file, plots a linear regression curve for the data, and calculates protein levels based on a few inputs from the user.
